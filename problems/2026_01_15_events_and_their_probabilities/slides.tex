\begin{frame}{Monty Hall Problem}
\small 
\begin{center}

\end{center}

There are three doors on the set for a game show. Behind one door is a car and behind the other two doors are goats. \\
\vfill 

You get to pick a door to open. The host of the show then opens one of the other doors and reveals a goat.  What should you do if you want to maximize your chance of winning the car: stay with your original door  or switch -- or would the likelihood of winning be the same either way?

\begin{enumerate}
\item  (1.2.1) Let $\set{A_i : i \in I}$ be a collection of sets. Prove De Morgan's Laws:
\[ \big( \cup_i A_i \big)^c = \cap_i A_i^c, \qquad \big( \cap_i A_i \big)^c = \cup_i A_i^c \]
\item (1.8.3a) Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a $\sigma$-field of subsets of $\Omega$.  Show that $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under countable intersections. That is, if $A_1, A_2, \hdots$ are in $\mathcal{F}$, then so is $\cap_i A_i$.
\item (1.2.2) Let $A$ and $B$ belong to  some $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{F}$.  Show that $\mathcal{F}$ contains the sets $A \cap B$, $A \setminus B$, and $A \, \triangle \, B$.
\item (1.3.2) A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Show that, with probability one, a head turns up sooner or later.  Show similarly that any finite sequence of heads or tails occurs eventually with probability one. 
\item (1.4.5i) \textbf{The Monty Hall Problem: goats and cars.} In a game show, you have to choose one of three doors. One conceals a new car, two conceal old goats. You choose, but your chosen door is not opened immediately. Instead, the presenter opens another door, which reveals a goat.  He offers you the opportunity to change your choice to a third door (unopened and so far unchosen).  Let $p$ be the (conditional) probability that the third door conceals the car.  Show that $p=2/3$, assuming that the presenter is determined to show you a goat (show with a choice of two, he picks one at random).
\item (1.5.9) Two fair dice are rolled. Show that the event that their sum is 7 is independent of the score shown by the first die.
\item (1.7.2) A hand of 13 cards is dealt from a normally shuffled pack of 52 cards. What is the probability that the hand contains exactly one ace given that it contains exactly two kings?
